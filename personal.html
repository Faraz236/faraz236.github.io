  Whenever I have free time, I like to work on my own personal robotics related projects. 
  Usually, I do these projects to learn new skills or how to use software tools that
  I am interested in but have not had the chance to learn in any course or research project. 
  Below are some of my personal projects and some of the stuff I learned from doing them.

<button type="button" class="collapsible" id="LIDARSLAM">Remote Controlled Robot with LIDAR</button>
<div class="content">
<h1>
  This project was inspired by the <a href="research.html#tractor">autonomous farming</a> and 
  <a href="personal.html#ORBSLAM">RC car with camera</a> projects I worked on during my junior year.
  I wanted to build something better than the RC car project that applied the things I learned in the autonomous farming project.
  I learned about the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/product-development/">Jetson Nano</a>,
  and how to install Ubuntu and ROS on it and I wanted to try to use it to make a robot. I also wanted to try to use a LIDAR and depth camera similar to what we did
  in the farming project. The following are the tasks I wanted this new robot to do:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Use mecanum wheels for omni-directional movement</li>
    <li>Be remote controlled with a Dualshock 4</li>
    <li>Use LIDAR and a depth camera to map its surroundings </li>
    <li>Have some sort of manipulator to interact with the world </li>
  </ul>

  The first major step was building the actual thing, which took a lot of time but thankfully I had some experience from the RC car project.
  I still learned many new lessons along the way such as battery and motor selection, proper wiring and circuit design. While I was working on the
  physical system, I was also setting up the Jetson Nano with ROS and the packages I needed for the LIDAR and controller so by the time I was done with
  the prototype I was ready to make it move. After a couple of failed prototypes, I managed to build one that worked fine.

  <div class="caption"> 
    The robot I built being remote controlled with a Dualshock 4.
  </div>

  After getting the robot to work with the Dualshock 4 and the LIDAR, the next step was
  to use the LIDAR data for mapping. Since I was using ROS already, I decided to try
  the <a href="https://wiki.ros.org/hector_slam">Hector SLAM</a> package for ROS. After
  some messing around I managed to make work on the robot.

  <div class="caption">

  </div>

  Hector SLAM worked fine except that I was using it in a long hallway that did not have many
  uniqure features, so it had trouble figuring out if it moved along the hallway or not.
  To fix this issue I will need to do some sensor fusion with the depth camera.
  That's where I left the project at, but I plan on coming back to it at some point to do the sensor fusion
  and try <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros">Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping
  </a> and add some sort of manipulator to make it interact with the environment.

  This project was inspired by the my work in the <a href="research.html#IRIS">Iris Lunar Rover</a> teleoperations team 
  back in summer 2020. The pandemic was in full swing and the <a href="https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/">
  CMU Robotics Institute Summer Scholars </a> was held remotely, which meant I had to work on a software 
  based project instead of a hands-on one. Even though it was not necessary for my Iris work, I still wanted to
  build an RC car with a camera to test out some computer vision software that we were planning on using
  on the rover. Specifically, <a href="https://colmap.github.io/">COLMAP</a> and <a href="https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2">
  ORB-SLAM2</a>, both of which worked with a single camera (just like Iris).

  <img src="pictures/rc-car.jpg" style="display:block;margin:auto;max-width:50%">
  <div class="caption"> 
    The RC car I built, equipped with a Rasberry Pi 3, Arduino Nano, and webcam.
  </div>

  This was my first time making a project like this (I just finished my sophomore year at that time), but
  it was a good learning experience on how to use the Rasberry Pi 3 remotely to control things. It worked
  fine for moving and taking images that I could use to create a point cloud reconstruction of my apartment
  using COLMAP.

  </div></div>
  
  <div class="caption"> 
    The RC car running and taking images (left), COLMAP point cloud reconstructed from the images (center and right).
  </div>
  
  It ended up being pretty useful for testing COLMAP reconstruction from sparse image data, but I needed to do some
  upgrades to make ORB-SLAM2 work on it. Thankfully, I was working on the <a href="research.html#tractor">autonomous farming</a>
  project at that time, so I knew exactly what I should do to make it work. I installed Ubuntu instead
  of Raspberry Pi OS so I can install ROS on the Pi which would allow me to publish the webcam image
  data using <a href="https://wiki.ros.org/usb_cam">usb_cam</a> so I can easily run ORB-SLAM2.
  I also replaced the wheels with mecanum wheels to make navigation inside of the apartment easier, and
  because I wanted to try them out.

  This project was a lot of fun and it helped me better understand Structure from Motion (SfM)
  and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). This was my first attempt at building something
  technical outside of class and I really enjoyed it, which is one of the reasons I decided to
  make the <a href="personal.html#LIDARSLAM">remote controlled robot with LIDAR</a> project.
